# HealthMate


### Description
This is a health app which will take your symptoms and how you are feeling as an input and will process the data using some machine learning and some logical coding at the backend. It will let you know if you are suffering from any disease or any kind of problem, supply you with appropriate and required information and will also give you an option to consult to the doctors online. Application will have complete end to end system for online consultation However if the online consultation is not sufficient you can also choose for the actual physical checkup from doctor and once consulted user could approach the doctor for any instruction and guideline again inside the system itself.

### Technologies

- Application is built with ```Android Studio IDE```.
- It uses ```XML``` at frontend and ```Java``` at the backend. 
- Along with java it also uses some machine learning models for processing user information and for providing user with appropriate results.
- As a part of machine learning, A ML model is built with ```Python``` and ```Jupyter Notebook``` and some disease symptoms data.
- A ML pipeline is built using ```scikit-learn``` and dimensionality reduction using ```PCA``` and model training using ```Descision Tree``` algorithm is performed as the steps in the pipeline.
- The model makes prediction with the accuracy of ```92.59%```
