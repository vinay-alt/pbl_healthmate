- As a part of machine learning, A ML model is built with python and jupyter notebook and some disease symptoms data.
- A ML pipeline is built using scikit learn and dimensionality reduction using PCA and model training using descision tree algorithm is performed as the steps in the pipeline.
- The model makes prediction with the accuracy of 92.59%
